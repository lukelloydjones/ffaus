This folder contains an R package (and hydrometric output) that compute 
hydrometrics from hydrological data generated by in-stream flow gauges. The code
and concept of functional flows is based on the Function Flows approach, which
is described here and in other relavent references cited in this work.

Yarnell, Sarah M., et al. "A functional flows approach to selecting ecologically 
relevant flow metrics for environmental flow applications." River Research and 
Applications 36.2 (2020): 318-324.

The code in ffaus R package is a heavily adapted translation of the Python libraries 
available from here https://github.com/leogoesger/func-flow.

The Python libraries have been heaviliy adapted for the Australian context but 
in parts still heavily resemeble the ideas implemented in the original code.

The script in this folder generates functional flow hydrometrics using the 
R script 'flowmer_ff_all_gauges.R' and R version 4.0.4. The R package 'ffaus' is 
installed at this stage using devtools::install("ffaus"), which requires devtools. 
It has been tested on my personal mac system and run on the Linux HPC node
with 'plot_out_base' on lines 171 and 211 set to NULL so plots are not produced.
The code at this stage is best run for full diagnostic plots using RStudio.

The 'flowmer_ff_all_gauges.R' R script uses the functions in ffaus to generate
hydrometrics for 100 gauges that span the MDB and were deemed relevant and
reliable by the hydrological FlowMER theme. The code and output in this folder
is designed to be fully reproducible via just running the 'flowmer_ff_all_gauges.R'
script. 

The output for each gauge site has been quality controlled via an initial run 
of the ffaus code using default parameters and then an updated run if diagnostic
plots shows aberrations due to default parameters not representing the variation in
the hydrograph of that site's hydrographs. 

This folder contains:

/data
  FlowMER_Streamflow_2014-20.csv
    - The hydrological data from the Murray- Darlin Basin (MDB) used as input 
      into the hydrometric computation. I have
      left this here as it is reasonably light weight and a user can just pick it
      up the code and have a go with these data. 
    - The flow values are in ML/day and has flow values for total flow (FLOW) and
      the portion contributed from Commonwealth Environemental Water Office (CEW)
      for each site. 
    - These are the raw data that are taken in and summarised by the process.

functional_flows_aus.pdf
  - A document that gives a brief introduction to the functional flow methodology
    and then a very detailed summary of the principal components of each functions
    metric calculation. 
  - Also contains troublshooting options and reasons for why you may see NAs in the
    output. 
  - You can also query each function in R as to its input and output for futher
    details.

/func_flow_r_aus.Rproj
  R project file, which should help with setting up the environment and allow
  for a quick try of the code.

flowmer_ff_all_gauges.R
  - R programming script that has the calls functions from the ffaus R package.
    The script reads the stream flow data in /data.

    The script iterates over the 100 gauges and takes default or 'special' parameters
    inpute to the ffaus master function 'getFFMetrics' and produces functional flows hydrometrics
    and exceedance metrics for both the observed flow and the counterfactual, which
    incorporated the contribution from the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office
    (CEWO). The results are written to /flowmer_all_gauges_ffaus_out for each 'valley' and 'site' 
    of interest.

/flowmer_all_gauges_ffaus_out
  For each valley the sites within that valley have subfolders that contain output
  in the form of diagnostic plots for key parts if the ffaus estimation process
  and the hydrometrics for the observed and counterfactual flows.

  /*valley*/*site*/
    - *.png includes diagnostic plots for each of the initiation flows,
      wet season, recession flows, and dry season. The vertical lines usually
      correspond to important markers e.g., date of dry season start and horizontal
      lines are usually thresholds. The smooth coloured linear are different layers
      of smoothing used through the overly complex code.

    - valley*_*site*_observed_metrics.csv 
      The exceedance and functional flow hydrometrics for the observed flows. 
      Please ask me if you have any questions.

    - valley*_*site*_counterfactual_metrics.csv
      Ditto above except for counterfactual flows.

    - valley*_*site*_global_hydrograph.png
      IMO a nice summary of the GLOBAL hydrograph that includes the counterfactual and observed
      flows along with visual summary of the seasons.
