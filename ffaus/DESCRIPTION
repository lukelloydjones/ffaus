Description: Summarise daily stream flow data using a customised  functional flows (FF) approach Yarnell et al. (2015) to the Australian context. FF focuses on retaining specific process-based components of the flow hydrograph, or functional flows, rather than attempting to mimic the full natural flow regime. Key functional components include magnitude, timing and duration of the wet-season initiation flows, wet-season base flows, peak magnitude flows, recession flows, dry-season low flows, and inter- annual variability.
